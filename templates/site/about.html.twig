                <p>
                  PLAYBOX stands for <em>"People Love Art, Y'know? But, Okay... X, huh?"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not really.

                <p>
                    We produce one mainstage show per year and one mini-festival of short pieces, offering a platform to early-career artists and experimental voices. Through our studio workshops, we cultivate the next wave of bold performers, directors, and writers.

        <p class="lead text-muted">
            Theater is a lab. An offering. A call. We make space for work that’s messy, tender, urgent, funny, and strange.
        </p>
        <p>
            We value shared leadership. We invite collaboration across disciplines. We pay artists. We know that great theater begins in a room of people who trust each other.
